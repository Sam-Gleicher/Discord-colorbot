This is a simple Discord bot which takes messages in a channel and then adds them to a csv. It is designed to be run periodically to record past messages rather than updating constantly. 

It currently can pull weather data if the locations of individuals are in the crosswalk, as well as adjusting dates to be in local time rather than where the code is run.
